# Simulation Development Status

Last updated: 2026-07-08 — updated with each release; every checkmark is verifiable in this repository's history.

## Legend

Capabilities tracked per task/engine:

1. Scene assets complete
2. Robot asset in scene
3. Teleoperation
   - 3.1 keyboard: gripper
   - 3.2 keyboard: base
   - 3.3 GELLO: gripper
   - 3.4 VR: gripper
   - 3.5 foot pedal: base
   - 3.6 keyboard: arm lift
4. Grasping works within contact-force limits
5. Full task run completable via teleoperation
6. Baseline model
7. Real-world dataset (200 episodes, GELLO + keyboard)

✅ = verified working in the current release. This matrix covers what is built and verified; the competition page lists all committed engines per task (e.g., Genesis for Task 2), which may not yet appear here.

Note: evaluation code in this repository (e.g., the Task 2 scoring module and the vendored ManipulationNet client) is a development facilitator; official scoring follows the official rules and scoring published on the competition page (https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html#tasks).

\* Task 3 MuJoCo: Committed engine — environment bring-up in progress; release will be announced on Discord and in this file. Tracked in [#14](https://github.com/EBiM-Benchmark/benchmark/issues/14).

## What can I develop against today?

Task 1 (MuJoCo) and Task 2 (Isaac Sim) are fully usable end-to-end; Task 2 teleoperation (keyboard/browser and GELLO + foot pedal on the mobile FR3 Duo) runs in plain Isaac Sim 5.1.0 via [`task2_isaacsim/`](task2_isaacsim/). Task 1 (Isaac Sim) is partially operational (GELLO/pedal teleoperation and grasping verified; end-to-end run pending). Task 3 environments are under active development — the Isaac Sim scene and robot are in place; MuJoCo is a committed engine with environment bring-up in progress, and its release will be announced on Discord and in this file. Baselines and the real-world dataset (200 episodes) release incrementally.
