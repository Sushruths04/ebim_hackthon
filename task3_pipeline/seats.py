"""Seat-target interface for Task 3 Stage 1 (Table Setup).

The organizer prose rules (the objective truth -- ``grading.py`` is only a
dev smoke-test, see ``config.py``) require carrying 4 objects (plate, cup,
bowl+beans, spoon) from the kitchen to "3 of 6 seats, randomly assigned per
episode".

FINDING (T1 discovery task, resolved 2026-07-24): there is NO separate
seat/chair geometry anywhere in ``assets/robot_room.usd``, and neither the
organizers' shipped Stage-1 grader
(``scripts/evaluation/task3/grading.py::score_stage1_table_setup`` /
``classify_table_area``) nor their integration test
(``upstream/main:scripts/evaluation/task3/integration_test.py::run_stage1``)
scores objects against seats at all -- both score objects by landing anywhere
in the ``TASK3_DINING_AREA`` rectangle (center (-2.85, 1.9), scale
5.9 x 3.4). No seat scorer ships anywhere; the official (non-dev) scorer is
unpublished.

What DOES exist in code are the real seating positions around the dining
table: ``TASK3_HEAD_PLACEMENTS`` in
``scripts/scenes/scene_robot_room_keyboard.py``, 9 named placements (A-I) at
tabletop height z=0.74659, all of which lie INSIDE the dining rectangle.

DECISION: use a subset of these real head-placement positions as the seat
targets. Placing the 4 Stage-1 objects at distinct such positions satisfies
the only scorer that actually ships (the dining rectangle) AND approximates
the organizer prose ("distinct seats") using real, grounded coordinates
instead of an invented mock. This module's public interface
(``assigned_seats`` / ``object_to_seat`` / ``SeatTarget``) is kept stable so
real per-episode seat-assignment data can drop in later without touching
``stages.py``.

OPEN ITEM: the organizer prose says "6 seats", but the scene only defines 9
head placements (A-I) and ships no seat scorer at all. Revisit this module if
the organizers ever publish real seat/chair geometry or a seat-aware scorer.
