"""The auto-verifier: turn measured state into a labelled skill outcome.

This is the automated replacement for a human staring at a GIF. Every number
used here (gripper angle, position error, object z) is something the existing
skills already measure and log -- we just classify it into a discrete outcome
and a machine-readable diagnosis so the retry policy can act on it.

All functions are pure and CPU-testable (no Isaac, no torch).
