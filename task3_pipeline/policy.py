"""The retry policy: choose the next parameter set to try after a failure.

This is the automated version of a human reading the changelog and hand-editing
one constant. It is FAR / Reflexion "retry-with-adjustment": pick the next
candidate from a small bounded grid, best-known-first (from memory), skipping
combinations already known to fail, and biasing the choice by the *diagnosis*
of the last failure (e.g. an IK_FAIL flips the stance before touching offsets).

Pure logic, fully CPU-testable. No training, no GPU.
